          <h3>Missile 3D Design</h3>
          <p>
            As part of my aerospace design coursework, I developed a full 3D model
            of a tactical missile using 3DExperience.  
            In the frame of a full teoretical definition, the objective was to define an optimized aerodynamic shape, internal
            component arrangement, and surface continuity for aerodynamic efficiency.
            This included modeling the propulsion chamber, nozzle contour, and fin
            assemblies, ensuring realistic mass distribution and manufacturability.

          <h3>Ariane 5 Structural Design Study</h3>
          <p>
            I worked on a 3D modeling study of the Ariane 5 launcher, focusing on the
            first stage structure and interstage configuration.  
            Using 3DExperience, I analyzed the integration of tanks, boosters, and fairing
            connections while maintaining lightweight efficiency and structural
            rigidity.  
            This project provided deep insight into complex launcher assemblies and
            structural design constraints at system level.

          <h3>Cryogenic Test Bench Skid</h3>
          <p>
            During my internship at Ateliers Bigata, I took part in the complete
            3D conception & optimization of a cryogenic test bench used for high-pressure liquid
            nitrogen and hydrogen testing.  
            The model integrated over <strong>300 unique components</strong>, including
            valves, insulation supports, pressure manifolds, and control & safety systems.
            This large-scale assembly required precise mechanical design coordination,
            tolerance management, and fluid integration consistency.  
            I was responsible for both the system architecture and the CAD assembly
            definition used for manufacturing.

          <h3>Helicopter blade component design</h3>
          <p>
            At Airbus, I contributed to the design of a new generation composite blade
            by applying <strong>Shape Generative Design</strong> methods within CATIA
            3DExperience.  
            This approach allowed the creation of optimized geometries for improved
            aerodynamic and structural performance.  
            I performed surface continuity checks and mechanical integration
            verifications between generative components and conventional structures.

          <h3>Historical Aircraft Restoration</h3>
          <p>
            As part of a project of heritage preservation initiative, I recreated in 3D a 
            flight control component from the Deperdussin monoplane (1912), 
            one of the earliest aircraft equipped with a closed cockpit and advanced control ergonomics.
            The objective was to reconstruct the original command linkage based solely on archival photographs and museum references, 
            and to produce detailed manufacturing drawings for possible restoration or educational purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using CATIA V5, I developed a precise 3D model of the mechanical system including levers, joints, and pivot assemblies. 
            The reconstruction required geometric interpretation, proportional scaling from historical imagery, 
            and CAD constraint definition to replicate the original movement of the control column.
