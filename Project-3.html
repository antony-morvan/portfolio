                        The dual-stream mixer 
                        was analyzed to study internal flow mixing performance and pressure losses within a complex geometry. 
                        The objective was to optimize mixing efficiency between primary and secondary streams while maintaining 
                        acceptable total pressure recovery.

                    As part of an <strong>aerodynamic and launch vehicle study</strong>, I conducted 
                    a CFD analysis on the <span class="highlight-blue">Ariane 5</span> launcher
                    to evaluate the external flow behavior during ascent and assess

                    along the vehicle body.

                <p class="text-md text-justify">
                    The objective was to identify <strong>critical aerodynamic zones</strong>, 
                    such as shock intersections and flow separation near the fairing and booster junctions.
                    Using <strong>ANSYS Fluent</strong> and numerical post-processing tools, I visualized 
                    Mach contours, stagnation pressure fields, and temperature gradients to 
                    characterize the impact of compressibility at high-speed regimes.
